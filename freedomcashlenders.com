Most of us are very aware of the fact that we all need to work in order to live and to provide for our personal needs and of our loved ones' necessity. We are all burdened of this fact that sometimes, it makes us feel that we would be useless and worthless if we are not working. However, we cannot really deny the importance of our work, since it is our assurance that we can cope with the fast pace lifestyle that this 21st century has.

Moreover, having a job that will give you the opportunity of earning money is not absolutely permanent. There will come a time that you will be unemployed and wandering in the different establishments, inquiring if there is vacancy. Every minute that you will be not working, would make you realize more the importance of having a stable job.
